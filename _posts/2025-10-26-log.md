**Reflections**

- **What worked:** Going to the gym with a workout buddy kept motivation high.  
- **What broke:** Work balance remains skewed; workload is stressful.  
- **Adjustment:** Refocus on core work priorities to reduce the growing task backlog. Make slides for week in review.

**Closing Thought:**  
Art makes me happy, and I am so excited to be working on a new home decor oriented project. Response to comics has been slow after hiatus. However, work still has to be priority.
